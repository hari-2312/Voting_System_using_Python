# VOTING SYSTEM USING PYTHON
creating a 'voting system using python' with tkinter and sqlite3 libraries is a great project that can 
help understand GUI developement and database management.
this project involves building a graphical user interface(GUI) where users can cast their votes for different candidates or
options, and the votes are stored in a Sqlite database for later analysis or reporting.
we can create polls, vote in them and view their results. We have used matplotlib library, to project the results in a pie-chart and bar-chart formats.
